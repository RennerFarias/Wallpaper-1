After a long period of frustration, as Iâ€™ve always enjoyed changing my system wallpapers frequently, I created a massive pack with a variety of photos that I thought would be great. I organized the collection into two folders, named wallpaper-1 and wallpaper-2, since I couldn't store everything in a single repository. Initially, I made it for personal use, but now it's available for anyone to enjoy and use freely.
